write parentheses your name next to whatever list of jobs there are left to do in programming.
and type finished if it's done

after you are done, do a pull request on the code (do not do a commit), so we can review it and make sure it doesn't conflict with other pull requests.

ie.

    finished code: 
        UpdateCode for the LOLZ (An-finished)

    unfinished code:
        Update Code for the LOLZ (An)

    Drive_Code:
        Members:
            -Andres
            -Melody
        Requirements:
            -finish Exponential relationship between controller values (-127 -> 127) and controller power (-100 -> 100) (percentage, honestly you can do whatever measurement)
                -make sure this accommodates for dead zones so that means when dead zone is gone (exponential function starts)
                -desmos link has example, go do math and code.

            -Finish Lift Stack Code(PID) + Lift Buttons (manipulate stack count) 
                -make sure Lift Buttons 
                -make sure PID uses voltage and input is from potentiometer
                -if doing manual control, make sure there is a toggle between pid and manual

            -Finish Claw Code (PID - OPEN/CLOSE) 
                -make sure there is a toggle between pid and manual.
                -voltage pid control with potentiometer
            
            -Theoretically all I need to do after you are done with your code (assuming it all works), is to figure out the values of constants through measurements.

            -Once ur done, pull request into master.
