This file will give you a quick crash course on Robotmesh C++ programming and will hopefully get you familiarized with programming

API: The API is basically a library that contains functions and code that you can use for a specific purpose. In this case, Robotmesh
has an API that allows you to access the hardware in V5.

Link to the API:
https://www.robotmesh.com/docs/vexv5-cpp/html/index.html

C++ language: Robotmesh also supports the standard use of C++ and its many tools. This means that it is also good to familiarise yourself
with the ins and outs of C++. Although it is not mandatory, it is highly recommended, as it will increase your toolbelt and could possibly
make your coding life easier.

Things you need to know inside of RobotMesh API:

    -How to write the Competition format

    -How to declare v5 devices

    -How to spin motors

    -How to read numbers from sensors

    -How to read things from controllers

    -How to get controller to do things on motors

Things you may or may not need in Robotmesh API:

    -Printing and drawing on V5 Brain

    -read/write Serial (idk y i just wrote this, you prob don't need this)

    -Multi threading (recommended to keep away from this until absolutely necessary)

    -PWM (if ur edgy, u can use this)


For C++ beginners, it is good to familiarise yourself with these topics:

    -Functions: how to write a function - how to read a function - restrictions of functions - purpose of functions

    -Data Types: learning about different data types - how to convert(if possible) between data types - how to declare variables of certain data types
    
    -Arrays: how to write an array - why arrays are implemented
    
    -Constants: how to write a constant - why constants are used
    
    -Loops: Learn about For loops, Do Loops, and While Loops
    
    -Logic: AND operators, OR operators, XOR operators, NOT operators, ...etc.

            -Also learn how to translate thought into code.

    -Debug: practice by going through code when there are errors and finding the error (it is recommended to read line by line like how a mahchine would read it)

For those who are already familiar with C++ and are ready for the next level, consider these topics: Of course, none of these are needed, but they help expand your toolbox

    -Structures: how to write structures

    -Classes: Object-Oriented Programming and how to write classes

    -Pointers and References: how to write it - play around with it to see how it works

    -Dynamic Memory Allocation: how it works - how to write it - the risks of misuse

    -text file manipulation and reading: how to create data from a text file and read it from a c++ file

    -header files and cpp files: how to link them together and how file management works
    
For anyone that is going to program on Team2496R 2019-2020, familiarise yourselves with these algorithms:

    -Motion Profiling -> (you need to know a little bit of kinematics)

    -PID -> (do not be intimidated by integral or derivative ... think of integral as accumulated error and derivative as rate of change or dampener term)

    -rising edge 

If you have no life look at these algorithms: BTW, each topic is a struggle to go through, so tread carefully and do not die going through these.
    
    -Cubic/Quintic Hermite Spline Interpolation

    -Gaussian Quadrature Integration

    -Pure Pursuit

    -Encoder based Tank Drive Odometry Calculations
